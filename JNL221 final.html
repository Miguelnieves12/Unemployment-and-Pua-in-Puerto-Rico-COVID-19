  <h1>Labor market in Puerto Rico affected by COVID-19</h1>
  <p>All around the world countries suffered some sort of hit in their labor marktes. Puerto Rico was no exception but, in a nontraditional way.</h2>

<p> Throughout most of its existence, Puerto Rico has historically struggled with unemployment. During the last couple of years Puerto Rico has consistently been among the top states in poverty and unemployment rates, even though it’s not even a state. The island currently has a 40.5 percent poverty rate meanwhile the state with the highest rate belongs to Mississippi with 18.1 percent. If you zoom out and look at the country as a whole the poverty rate is only 11.6 percent. In the case of unemployment, as of October 2022, the unemployment rate in Puerto Rico was 6.5 percent. On the other hand, the rate for the whole U.S. was 3.7 percent for November 2022. Now, a curious person might think to themselves “What would happen to Puerto Rico’s labor situation if a lockdown of sorts that prevents people from working were to occur?”. Well, that situation right there is no longer hypothetical, it’s a reality that many puerto ricans and people around the world went through and are still going through. The COVID-19 pandemic as we all know by this point caused shutdowns all over the world and people lost their jobs because of it. Therefore, the answer to this hypothetical question is something that can actually be found now.</p>

 <p class="chart"><iframe title="COVID-19 had minimal impact in Puerto Rico's unemployment" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-oN74i" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oN74i/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

<p> As the graph above shows, Puerto Rico didn’t really change a lot in regards to the unemployment rate. The line just takes on a wave form since it fluctuates from up and down but it never sky rockets into eye opening numbers. New York produces the eye opening numbers that one would expect after a lockdown. Especially since New York is home to one of the biggest cities in the world in New York City, “the city that never sleeps”. It peaked right at the start of the pandemic during April and May but it has gone on a slow but steady decline to normality. In less than a year it already was lower than Puerto Rico’s rate at that time, which is pretty impressive since at one time it doubled the island’s number.  </p>

<p>In a response by the United States government to combat the pandemic and try to aid its citizens, on March 18, 2020  former president  Donald Trump signed into law the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which provided additional flexibility for state unemployment insurance agencies and additional administrative funding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the aids brought in with this law was the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) with the purpose of helping unemployed and self-employed workers. This aid was available from 2020 to the end of 2021. During the duration of PUA they have paid out $9,594,455,477.13 where more than 73 thousand people benefited from the program. The government paid about $36 million weekly to applicants, said Joe Rodriguez, an economist for the government in Puerto Rico.   </p>

<p class="chart"><iframe title="PUA claims soared in Puerto Rico's working age population" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-2AKqQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2AKqQ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="264" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

<p>The data shown in the graph is really eye opening considering what the previous graph showed. New York was the one that saw a bigger hit in unemployment but that didn’t translate into PUA claims. In the duration of the aid it only peaked at 12.85% of the working age population. Puerto Rico on the other hand had high numbers even though the data from the last chart shows that the Island didn’t have a big change in unemployment. A reason for these numbers for both Puerto Rico and New York could come down to the self-employed people in the population. In 2020, 16.63% of total employment were self-employed. Some of these are artisans who work in Old San Juan, a big tourist location, and if there are travel restrictions due to lockdowns they aren’t working. Other common examples seen in the island are food trucks or small food places that most of the time are family run. New York had 9.9% of total employment as self-employed in 2020. New York would see this probably more in New York City where anyone that has visited would say that there’s food carts almost everywhere. </p>

<p>While self-employment could explain part of the disparity in the chart by both the states. There is still a margin that would be left with a question mark since self-employment doesn’t fill the gaps all the way. According to Rodriguez, fellow economists in Puerto Rico have two ways of seeing the program. Some establish that it only made sense during the lockdown stage of the pandemic. The aid could’ve helped influencing labor shortages in the post-lockdown stage. The lower paid working class were the ones that benefited the most since employers were forced to pay scales in order to make the market more attractive. The minimum wage in Puerto Rico was $7.25 per hour during that program period. While New York state’s was $13.75 in 2020 and $14.50 in 2021 per hour.</p>

<p>This may have caused people in Puerto Rico that started to receive benefits from PUA to come to the conclusion that they would make more money from the aid than actually working, which might be why some economists believe that it influenced labor shortages. Some people went even further and decided to take advantage of the program to make money. They applied for jobs so they could show evidence to the department of labor that they’re looking for a job and receive money. This is the case of “Hospicio Amor y Tranquilidad” (Love and Tranquility hospice) where people would call for an interview, come to the interview and later on when they got the job, they wouldn’t show up. In the job application the hospice would fill out a form for the applicant that was all they needed for the aid. A job applicant even admitted that she didn’t take the job because she just took the benefits instead, Sara Nicole, a former employee for the Hospice said. This happened in other places around the island and caused businesses to have more losses than what they were already going through. Some restaurants had to stop doing delivery because they couldn’t find drivers, others closed entirely. After PUA was officially done, some stories started to come out about how the government is investigating PUA fraud. On March 24, 2022 the Department of Labor had referred over 700 cases of possible PUA fraud. Two of the most notable cases were one lady that used three different identities and got 21 charges for PUA fraud of $24,840; and another lady who used the identity of an elder to fraudulently pick up $9,456. Showing the backwards effect of a program aimed to help people in need.</p>
